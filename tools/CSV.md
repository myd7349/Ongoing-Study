> CSV seems so easy that many programmers have written code to generate it themselves, and almost every implementation is different. Handling broken CSV files is a common and frustrating task. CSV has no standard encoding, no standard column separator and multiple character escaping standards. String is the only type supported for cell values, so some programs attempt to guess the correct types.

> 
> The biggest missing piece is an import/export filter for popular spreadsheet programs so that non-programmers can use this format.
