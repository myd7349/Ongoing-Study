[Thread.Sleep(0) vs Sleep(1) vs Yeild](https://www.cnblogs.com/stg609/p/3857242.html)

C# 9.0 in a Nutshell

> Thread.Sleep(0) relinquishes the threadâ€™s current time slice immediately, voluntarily handing over the CPU to other threads. Thread.Yield() does the same thing except that it relinquishes only to threads running on the same processor.

[High resolution timer in C#](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24839105/high-resolution-timer-in-c-sharp)

> There is an option: use `Thread.Sleep(0)`. Attempt to call `Thread.Sleep(1)` or employ a `System.Threading.Timer` would always come down to system timer resolution.

> `Thread.Yield()` will reduce the chance of a context-switch. `Thread.Sleep(0)` results in a context switch to lower priority processes. Elevating the current process priority will decrease the chance of `Thread.Yield()` itself context-switching.

[C# Is value type assignment atomic?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53601121/c-sharp-is-value-type-assignment-atomic)

> Reads and writes of the following data types are atomic: *bool*, *char*,  *byte*, *sbyte*, *short*, *ushort*, *uint*, *int*, *float*, and *reference types*. In  addition, reads and writes of *enum types* with an underlying type in  the previous list are also atomic. Reads and writes of other types,  including *long*, *ulong*, *double*, and *decimal*, as well as user-defined  types, are not guaranteed to be atomic. Aside from the library  functions designed for that purpose, there is no guarantee of atomic  read-modify-write, such as in the case of increment or decrement.

[Is ++ operation atomic in C#?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17872057/is-operation-atomic-in-c)

> No ++/-- is not an atomic operation, however reading and writing to  integers and other primitive times is considered an atomic operation.

[Difference in usage and implementation of ManualResetEvent(Slim), Semaphore(Slim) and ReaderWriterLock(Slim)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6764864/difference-in-usage-and-implementation-of-manualreseteventslim-semaphoreslim)

> `ReaderWriterLockSlim` is a better version of `ReaderWriterLock` that is faster and  doesn't suffer from writer starvation
>
> `ManualResetEventSlim` and `SemaphoreSlim` are fully managed versions of a `ManualResetEvent` and `Semaphore` that spin-wait for a while before falling back to kernel objects, and  so are faster than the old versions when wait times are short.

[What's the difference between Invoke() and BeginInvoke()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/229554/whats-the-difference-between-invoke-and-begininvoke)

> `Control.Invoke`: Executes on the UI thread, but calling thread waits for completion before continuing.

[Recursive (Re-entrant) Locks](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/04/recursive-re-entrant-locks.html)

> Traditionally, recursive locks have been the default on Microsoft platforms. The `lock` statement, `Monitor`, `Mutex`, and `ReaderWriterLock` are all recursive. However, newer types are starting to change this; `SpinLock` is not recursive, and `ReaderWriterLockSlim` is not recursive by default (it does provide recursion as an option).
