> Encode to hex. Seriously. It’s url-safe and sql-safe. It compresses better than base64, it faster and trivial to safely encode/decode, no padding mess, no incompatibilities between decoders (due to how they handle non-zero padding bits).

> The difference between Base64 and hex is really just how bytes are  represented. Hex is another way of saying "Base16". Hex will take two  characters for each byte - Base64 takes 4 characters for every 3 bytes,  so it's more efficient than hex.
