>As discussed in chapter 9, while the FFT is more efficient in terms of the required multiplications than the Goertzel algorithm or the direct computation of the DFT, it is less efficient than either if the dominant metric is communication cycles since direct computation or the Goertzel algorithm can be much more highly parallelized than the FFT.

>In a multicore environment, for example, direct computation of the DFT (or the use of the Goertzel al-gorithm) is more "efficient" than the use of an FFT algorithm since, although many more multiplications are required, communication requirements are significantly reduced because the processing can be more efficiently distributed among multiple processors or cores.
