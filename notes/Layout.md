WPF Control Development Unleashed Building Advanced User Experiences (Pavan Podila)

> Layout in WPF is handled using the two-phased approach of measure and arrange.
> 
> During the measure phase, the parent requests that each of its children supply their
> minimum-required dimensions. The parent then applies additional requirements such as
> margins, alignment, and padding.
> 
> Once each child has been measured, the parent panel then performs the arrange phase.
> During this phase, the parent panel places each child control in its actual position in the
> final dimensions. The final position and size of the child element may not be what the
> child element requested. In these scenarios, the parent panel is the final authority on
> where the child controls are and how much space they take up.
